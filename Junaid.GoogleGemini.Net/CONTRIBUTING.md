# Contributing
Feel free to improve the library!

I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Documenting code
- Submitting a fix
- Refactoring code
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Guidelines for Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Adhere to the established code style within the project.
3. Use meaningful commit messages.
4. Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality.
5. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
6. Update the documentation if you have added features.

## Report bugs using [Github issues](https://github.com/jaslam94/Junaid.GoogleGemini.Net/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/jaslam94/Junaid.GoogleGemini.Net/issues/new). 

Would appreciate if you can write a bug report in the description. An [example](https://gist.github.com/czottmann/3402842) of a bug report that would be helpful.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
- Any attachments (like screenshot)
